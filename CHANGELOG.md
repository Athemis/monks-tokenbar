## Version 1.0.5
Fixed issue with the global movement status only clearing out the first token's specific movement.  Looks like I wasn't waiting for the setFlag function to complete before moving on to the next one.
Added greater visibility for specific movement settings.  The context menu will now highlight whatever movement setting the token has.

## Version 1.0.4
Fixing an issue with tokens that don't have passive perception for some reason

## Version 1.0.3

Bug fixes.
The movement restriction wasn't working.
Stripped out the things that weren't working in Pathfinder.
Corrected issues with the turn notification
