## Version 1.0.14
Adding option to disable the token bar, now that it's available for players to see.

Added the option to turn off changing the movement to combat when an encounter is started.

Changed the Add player on the request saving throw to add the currently selected tokens, rather than using it as a toggle switch to add tokens being clicked.  It was very unintuitive.

Changed to the code so that Pathfinder changes to ac and perception are reflected.

## Version 1.0.12
Adding a setting so that players can now see their own tokens on a bar.  Should be helpful for players with companions.

Sort of added the start of customisable stats for the bar.

## Version 1.0.11
Adding support for pathfinder rolls

## Version 1.0.10
Fixed issue with saving throws getting into a loop informing each other that the roll had finished.

Fixed an issue with contested rolls not rendering properly.

## Version 1.0.9
Fixed issue with multiple tokens being added or removed from scene.

You can now reposition the token bar.

Chinese translations

Fixed an issue where multiple tokens associated with a single actor only rolling once.

Remember the last roll mode and reuse it the next time opening the saving throw.

## Version 1.0.8
Fixed issues with the players not able to roll.

Upgraded some of the code behind the scenes to make it all a little more stream lined.

Upgraded the contested roll scripts to use code upgraded for the saving throws.

## Version 1.0.7
TokenBar will respect DnD5e request to disable XP tracking and will hide the XP button on the bar and not open the XP dialog if the checkbox is checked.

Fixed issue with a mass roll not updating properly.

Added the option to show the tokens resource bars.

Cleaned up the code a bit so that macros can call it easier.

## Version 1.0.6
Fixed issue with movement notification showing even though no movement change has happened.

Fixed the bug where a player could still move their token with arrow keys even though movement was locked

## Version 1.0.5
Fixed issue with the global movement status only clearing out the first token's specific movement.  Looks like I wasn't waiting for the setFlag function to complete before moving on to the next one.

Added greater visibility for specific movement settings.  The context menu will now highlight whatever movement setting the token has.

After combat was complete, the Assign XP Dialog was showing for everyone.  Limited that to just the GM.

## Version 1.0.4
Fixing an issue with tokens that don't have passive perception for some reason

## Version 1.0.3

Bug fixes.
The movement restriction wasn't working.
Stripped out the things that weren't working in Pathfinder.
Corrected issues with the turn notification
